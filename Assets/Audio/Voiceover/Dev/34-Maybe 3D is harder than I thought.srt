1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,607
Wait, why’s the door not working?

2
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:03,658
Did you break it?

3
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:05,595
I’m sure this is
Josh’s fault somehow…

4
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:09,451
I don’t know, maybe this 3D
thing is harder than I thought.

5
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:12,813
Plus that horse model
was really expensive,

6
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:16,003
I can't keep dropping that kind
of cash for much longer…

7
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:17,148
You know what,

8
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:20,119
I remember my nephew saying
he likes challenging games!

9
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:21,481
Let’s give those a try!

10
00:00:21,506 --> 00:00:24,166
Here, I’ve cooked
something up for you to try out!
